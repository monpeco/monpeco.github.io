    <h1>My Favorite Recepies!!!!!</h1>
    
    <p>This is my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the sugars, flour and spices; set aside. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom crust; trim pastry even with edge. Fill with apple mixture; dot with butter. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in pastry.</li>
        <li>Beat egg white until foamy; brush over pastry. Sprinkle with sugar. Cover edges loosely with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375Â° for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake 20-25 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool on a wire rack. Yield: 8 servings.</li>
